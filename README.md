# WKP5-A
Part A of the weekend project!

This project does highly define my strategy regarding how can I solve problems, what will be the improvement and what I have succeded.

1. I have actually done a little bit of the project. Firstly, I used map() method to access and loop through each arrays inside of the object. I don't really understand how it works but when I google for rendering an object array into html, I saw this method, I applied it and so it works as I needed. This is only for showing three recipes with their attributes when clicking on GENERATE RECIES button. Secondly, I used event delegation with the shown modal to get the values from recipes array object after clicking on "More Info" button inside of each recipe card.

2. My project didn't meet the requiremwnts because I could only finish appearing the modal that shows the rest of the recipe object so far. And I couldn't change stepos and ingredients into lists not to mention the further task for the form to add a new recipe.

3. I think I could have done at list putting the steps and ingredients inside of lists if I had more time. For the next improvement, I must comment my code because it is very hard to understand.
